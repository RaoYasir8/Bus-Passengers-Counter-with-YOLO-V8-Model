# Bus-Passengers-Counter-with-YOLOv8
This project implements a real-time Bus Passenger Counter using YOLOv8 for accurate object detection and tracking.
It detects and counts passengers entering and exiting the bus through video stream processing, ensuring reliable and automated monitoring.
The system demonstrates practical application of Computer Vision and Deep Learning for smart transportation solutions.
